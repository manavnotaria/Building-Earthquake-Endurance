Which factors affect the severity of the damage of a building after an earthquake?

Predicting the severity of damage of a building after an earthquake will be a very useful tool to the civil engineering and architecture industry.

**Variables Considered**
1. Age
2. Foundation type 
3. Height
4. Count Floors
5. Land surface condition 
6. Ground floor type
7. Roof type

 
**Conclusion**

Foundation type is the most influential factor in determining the severity of the damage of a building after an earthquake

Age and Height also plays a major role based on the classification models

Land surface condition plays little to no role
